Steps to Host Your Website on GitHub Pages:
Create a GitHub Repository:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Create a new repository. The name can be anything, but if you want the site to be accessible directly (without specifying a path), name the repository as:
<username>.github.io (replace <username> with your GitHub username).
Add Your Static Files:

Upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository.
Make sure your main file (the home page) is named index.html.
Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to the Settings of your repository.
Scroll down to the Pages section:
Select the Branch where your files are located (usually main).
Click Save.
After a few minutes, your website will be live at <username>.github.io.
Connect a Custom Domain:

If you have a custom domain and want to use it instead of the default GitHub URL:
Go to the Pages section in the repository settings and add your custom domain.
In your domain’s DNS management panel, create a CNAME record pointing to <username>.github.io.
DNS changes might take a few hours to propagate.
Important Notes:
GitHub Pages is designed for static websites and does not support backend functionality or databases.
If you need more advanced features, you can consider alternatives like Vercel or Netlify, which also support static sites and offer additional features for free.




1. Log in to Your Domain Provider's Account
  Go to the website where you purchased your domain (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.).
  Log in to your account.
2. Find the DNS Management or Settings Section
  Look for something like DNS Settings, DNS Management, Manage DNS, or Domain Settings.
  This is where you can manage records like CNAME, A, etc., for your domain.
3. Add a New Record
  Once you’re in the DNS settings section, look for an option to Add Record or Create New Record.
  Select the CNAME option (sometimes listed under record types like A, MX, CNAME, etc.).
4. Enter the CNAME Details
  Name/Host/Record Name: Enter the subdomain you want to connect (e.g., www if you want to connect www.yourdomain.com, or leave it blank for the root domain).
  Value/Points To: Enter your GitHub Pages URL: <username>.github.io (replace <username> with your GitHub username).
  TTL (Time to Live): Leave it as the default value (e.g., 1 hour or Auto).
5. Save the Record
  Click Save or Add Record to apply the changes.
  6. Wait for Propagation
  It may take a few minutes to a few hours for the changes to propagate globally.
  Once it’s updated, your domain will point to your GitHub Pages site.

  
Example for Clarity:
If your GitHub username is johnsmith, and your domain is example.com:

You’d create a CNAME record:
Name/Host: www
Value/Points To: johnsmith.github.io
Then www.example.com will load your GitHub Pages website.

If you want to connect the root domain (example.com without the "www"), additional steps might be needed, such as adding an A record pointing to GitHub’s IP addresses (you can find this information in the GitHub Pages documentation).
